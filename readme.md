## Overview

JHalaman is a Java application I made for plant leaves image recognition using leaf external features.

This is what's left in my dropbox college folder from college years.
Because this was just an early backup of the code, there are only basic image preprocessings written in Java. I will try to find DVD backup of the final version when I returned to my parents house.
